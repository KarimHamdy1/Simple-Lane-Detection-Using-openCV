# Simple-Lane-Detection-Using-openCV

Simple Lane detection using openCV
The algorithm is simple detection of lines using probabilistic hough line, calculating the slope of each line
(assuming left and right lane)
then calculating the furthest and lowest points on both lanes.
then draw lines and polygon between them to indicate the lane.
